This directory contains the documentation for nanomsg library. To build the
documentation (both man pages and web pages) do "./configure --enable-doc" and
"make" in the build directory; man pages will be installed with "make install".
The prerequisites for building the documentation are asciidoc and xmlto
utilities.
